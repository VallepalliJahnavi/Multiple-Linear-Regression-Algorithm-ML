# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Algorithm-ML
Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables. In essence, it aims to find the linear equation that best fits the data by minimizing the sum of the squared errors.

In practical terms, multiple linear regression can be used to make predictions about a dependent variable based on the values of two or more independent variables. For example, a multiple linear regression model could be used to predict a person's salary based on their education level, years of experience, and age.

To perform multiple linear regression, one must first collect data on the dependent and independent variables. Then, the data can be fed into a software package or programming language that can calculate the coefficients of the linear equation that best fits the data. The coefficients represent the strength and direction of the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.

In addition to making predictions, multiple linear regression can also be used to identify which independent variables are most strongly associated with the dependent variable. This information can be useful for understanding the underlying factors that influence the dependent variable.

Overall, multiple linear regression is a powerful tool for analyzing data and making predictions. However, it is important to ensure that the assumptions of the technique are met and that the results are interpreted correctly.
